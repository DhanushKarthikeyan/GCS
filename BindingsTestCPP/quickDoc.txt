About compiling C++ modules to NodeJS/Electron compatible modules:

Have electron 1.7.12+, and electron-rebuild 1.7.3+ installed.

The current comms protocol requires Boost.
Install using apt-get/brew/your fav package manager



Running the compiler:

Create binding.gyp file. Give your addon a target_name, and all the source
files to compile. Also include custom libraries or paths to include.

Note:

For mac:
   The libboost dependencies are located/set up in a different manner on MacOS:
   Change the libraries in binding.gyp to contain the following url:
      "/usr/local/lib/libboost_thread-mt.dylib""

For Ubuntu:
   Change the libraries in binding.gyp to contain the follwing url:
      "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libboost_thread.so" (on 64-bit machine)

   32 bit machines will (most likely) have it in a different location.




Run 'npm install' on the root directory of the project
If successful, run 'electron-rebuild .'
If successful, then the module has been successfully compiled, and the
project is ready to be run.


To add a custom module to your project, the following statement is
needed:  require('./build/Release/<YOUR_CUSTOM_ADDON_NAME>');
Where YOUR_CUSTOM_ADDON_NAME is defined by the binding.gyp file.
